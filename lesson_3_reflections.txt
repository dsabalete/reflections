When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    When you want to share your work with other people or want to access from 
    an other machine.


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git 
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Because sometimes you do no want to change your code with some change 
    already commit to the remote from another place.
